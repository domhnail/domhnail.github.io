          I'm a fledgling developer, and I'm expanding my knowledge base by the day. For now, I have a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. Next will be Java, and C. My goal is to be as adaptable as possible. 
          <br>
          As I improve myself, I'll come back to this site and expand upon it. For now I've taken a brutalist approach to the visuals, and eschewed clutter to make for a straightforward browsing experience. I also focused on making sure this site was simple to scale and add on to, as my experience grows and I have more projects to list.

          I'm a voracious reader. I prefer C.S. Lewis over Tolkien, and Gene Wolfe over Lovecraft. But if you asked me to pick between the four of them, I'd be completely stumped. Besides fiction, I also read philosophy, mythology, ancient history and the Bible.

          My taste in music mainly consists of jazz, but I branch out into too many other genres to name. Right now I like Japanese PC-98 game OSTs.
